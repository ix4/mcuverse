# :warning: DEPRECATED :warning:
I am in the process of closing this repo. I had issues with large assets bloating my .git and have since used BFG to clean my git history and move everything to Git LFS. Unfortunately GitHub's support for LFS costs and I no longer wish to pay the monthly fee. According to GitHub's own [docs](https://help.github.jp/enterprise/2.11/user/articles/removing-files-from-git-large-file-storage/#git-lfs-objects-in-your-repository) the only way to remove LFS objects is to delete the repo (and the issues with it :cry:). I've created a new repo that I will make public at some point. The new repo is a complete refactor to suport the unexpected amount of support the internet has shown and should make contributing easier and more maintainable. Hope everyone understands.
